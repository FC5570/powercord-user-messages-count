# User Messages Count
A plugin to show the amount of messages a user has.

## Note
This plugin makes a request to the Discord Search API with your token in headers, for which the plugin needs your consent as making an API request with the user token might be against Powercord's guidelines, and against Discord's TOS. It however, does not spam the API in any way and only makes a single request whenever you run a command, only if you give consent to the plugin to use your token.
